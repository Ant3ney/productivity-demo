## Major issues

Sign out doesn't always work. After testing my app with supertokens after a while, it would something not sign out when I call its dedicated signOut function
In order to fix this, I would have to go into the browser dev tools and remove cookies associated with supertokens

The docs don't make it advous how to get user data. I wasted a lot of time thinking I had missed something and did a lot of unnecessary searching.

## Notes decisions and feedback

I appreciate having the option between self hosting and Sass

I wished that after choosing Sass or self hosting I was directed to documentation

I like the choice you get from recipes

I found the docs useful on the topics it talked about

The system for setting up react router seems clunky

I immediately noticed how useful this code can be

Part way through testing by backend I had to add Access-Control-Allow-Origin‚Äù to the allowed headers

I Felt lost on how to actually get user data

Signout failed to work a lot of the time.
