## productivity-demo SuperTokens vs Auth0
Compares SuperTokens to Auth0
 
Please note, I may be harsher to SuperTokens because I was more rusty on implementing auth code when I implemented SuperTokens.  After Implementing SuperTokens, I felt much more comfortable and effective at implementing Auth0
 
# There are more README files like this
More SuperTokens Notes can be found on the client branch
More Auth0 notes can be found on the a0-client branch

## SuperTokens Vs Auth0
- SuperTokens and Auth0 both had good support for authentication on react. I did not know how to use 0auth like this before taking on this assignment
- SuperTokens had a better default login portal. Instead of taking up an entire page, the auth portal was displayed like a react component. I appreciated that.
- Auth0 is faster to set up since it does not initially require a google secret and client ID.
- I really benefited from being able to search up Auth0 stack overflow questions when I got stuck
- Overall Auth0 felt easier to set up, I ran into less bugs and issues with Auth0. (I'm aware I'm a bit biased but I still felt this was true)
